# üí£ GitHub Actions

[![Ministry of Justice Repository Compliance Badge](https://github-community.service.justice.gov.uk/repository-standards/api/github-actions/badge)](https://github-community.service.justice.gov.uk/repository-standards/github-actions)

> A single pane of glass for discovering **reusable GitHub Actions and Workflows** maintained across the Ministry of Justice.

This repository does **not** host any GitHub Actions or Workflows itself. Instead, it serves as a **discovery hub** for teams across MoJ to advertise their reusable GitHub automation tools, enabling greater collaboration, consistency, and efficiency across projects.

## üß≠ Purpose of This Repository

This repo acts as a **directory** of reusable GitHub Actions and Workflows maintained by MoJ teams. It is designed to:

- Encourage **reuse** of existing automation
- Avoid duplication of effort
- Promote **visibility** of automation best practices
- Help teams **contribute and maintain** shared solutions

## üîç What Are Reusable GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions can automate workflows for CI/CD, security checks, infrastructure provisioning, and more.

There are two main types of reusable automation:

- **Reusable Actions**: Individual building blocks that perform a specific task (e.g. `setup-terraform`, `slack-notify`)
- **Reusable Workflows**: Complete pipelines composed of multiple steps, which can be invoked using `workflow_call`

**Learn more:**

- [GitHub Docs: Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/sharing-automations/reuse-workflows)
- [GitHub Docs: Creating actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/sharing-automations/creating-actions)

## üß™ How to Use a Reusable Workflow

You can call reusable workflows from by using the `uses` attribute. Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  zizmor:
    name: Zizmor
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    uses: ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-github-actions/.github/workflows/reusable-zizmor.yml@<commit SHA> # <version>
```

> Make sure to check each repository‚Äôs README for usage instructions and required inputs/secrets.
